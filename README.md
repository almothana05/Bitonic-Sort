## Notes
The project is written in C++ (the Cuda part didn't change). might change `bitonic_sort.cu` to C.
- `test.cu` is just a code to test the bitonic sort algorithm. please just cange the lines with that has the comment `// adjustable`.
- `bitonic_sort.cu` is just the sort code.
-  I might have done some phalsaphah to optimize the code. So i added comments in `bitonic_sort.cu` that should help make the code more readable. Also i prolly gonna make a readable and less optimized version
